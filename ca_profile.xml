    I've been writing software since 7 years old, and have never outgrown my love of computers (and cats)! As a kid I spent a lot of time writing video game mods, especially for Minecraft. I got my Masters in Computer Science from the University of Utah. Today I am the VP of Software Engineering at a successful ed-tech startup. In my free time I like to play PC games, work on cars, build electronics, and play with my cats :)
